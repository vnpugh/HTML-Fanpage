    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>
        The Revolution was formed in 1979 by Prince in Minneapolis, MN. Though Prince first teased the band’s
        name on the 1999 album cover, the Revolution was given the full spotlight on Purple Rain, which went
        on to sell more than 20 million copies, spend 24 weeks at Number One on the album charts, and win two
        Grammys and an Oscar. The project marked the first time ever that an artist had a Number One album,
        single, and film simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>Following a tour that put them in front of sold-out stadium crowds, the Revolution backed Prince on his next two
        groundbreaking albums, Around the World In a Day and Parade. The group’s final recording on a Prince album is
        the
        show-stopping live track “It’s Gonna Be a Beautiful Night” on 1987’s Sign O the Times. After Prince’s death in
        April 2016, the Revolution immediately re-connected, but stayed out of the public eye until a series of three
        triumphant, emotional shows at the historic First Avenue club in September. Fans flew in from around the
        world to witness the band at the site where the concert scenes in Purple Rain were filmed.
